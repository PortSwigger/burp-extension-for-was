<p>The Qualys WAS Burp extension provides a way to easily push Burp scanner findings to the Web Application Scanning (WAS) module within the Qualys Cloud Platform. As a Qualys WAS customer, you can then view and report Burp issues alongside WAS findings for a more complete picture of your web application's security posture.</p>
